# BiBcWeek2

Author: Floor van der Zalm

Will finish this assignment in the afternoon on 23/09, after my exam for bioinfo. 
placed the plots I made on Theusday in the wrong branch (master ipv main). And still have to merge them + make the plots a bit prettier. 
Sorry for the delay, was working on the Unsupervised learning part of the practical and forgot to complete this at home. 

Content: Placed in the master branch - Code to plot a graph comparing the weight of male vs female chicken in a scatterplot
